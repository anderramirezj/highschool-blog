            Yes I'm Changing <br>
            Song by Tame Impala ‧ 2015 <br>
            Lyrics <br>
            I saw it different, I must admit <br>
            I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it <br>
            They say people never change <br>
            But that's bullshit, they do <br>
            <br>
            Yes, I'm changing, can't stop it now <br>
            And even if I wanted I wouldn't know how <br>
            Another version of myself I think I found, at last <br>

            <p>I’ve never met anyone as me. Everyone says they want to be a director, a cinematographer, something grand and creative. But when I look at what they do—or don’t do—it’s hard to believe them. Most of what I see feels empty, like they’re just going through the motions. They make these mindless projects, soulless and safe. But it’s not. It’s just noise.</p>

const poem = `I’m out here walking aimlessly, like a ghost in my own life. 
Every day feels like a loop, like I’m stuck in some endless hallway with no doors, 
just mirrors reflecting back all the things I could be but ain’t yet. 
I’m trying to do things, but it’s like my hands are tied by invisible strings.
I start something, and then—poof—it’s gone. Like, I’ve got a million ideas, 
a million dreams, but they’re all just floating in the air, and I can’t grab ‘em.

I’m visionary. 
I want to be famous. I want to be legendary. 
I want to be an artist that changes.
I’m a genius. I know it. I feel it. I’m the best of all time, but the **** just ain’t caught up yet. 
They don’t see it, but they will.`;
